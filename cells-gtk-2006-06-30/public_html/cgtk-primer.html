<h1>Introduction</h1>

<strong>[This is Work In Progress currently. My apologies.]</strong><p/>

Here we will discuss the most important parts of the cells-gtk GTK binding, and how
cells can be used in defining cells-gtk GUIs. This minimal introduction might be 
sufficient to get you started. We'll see.

<h2>Cells, Cell slots, and all that...</h2>

The example from <a href='http://bc.tech.coop/blog/030911.html'>Bill Clementson's Blog</a>
is a nice starting point. Read it and come back here.<p/>

...Welcome back. Perhaps you came back with the impression that Cells is a way to manage
the relationship among the values in the slots of a CLOS object. That would be good.
You might also imagine that if the slots describe the state of some real world object like a motor, 
you could use Cells to control the object -- to orchestrate how all its parts work together
toward some goal. That also would be good. Now, if that object were a GTK-based GUI... no
I'm getting ahead of myself. Let's look at the basic idea of Cells, it is similar to
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constraint_satisfaction">constraint satisfaction</a>.
That is, you have values, and rules that govern the relationships among the values,
and whenever the network is pushed out of a consistent state (i.e. whenever the rules 
no longer hold), the objective is to get it back to a consistent one by updating some values. 
In Bill's example, <em>status fuelpump</em> and <em>temp</em> are cells -- slots in 
a motor CLOS object whose values are managed by the cells constraint network. 
The constraint network itself might be depicted as this:
<p/>
[graph]
<p/>
In this graph the nodes are values and edges have rules attached. The collection of edges
into a node together with the rule are the cell. 
<!-- (hmmm is this going to work?) --> The green nodes
are values controlled by cells and the empty nodes are regular 'unmanaged' values 
(such as you get by reading the value from regular CLOS slot). 
<p/>
Cells such as <em>temp</em>, which have no edges leading into them, are called 'c-input cells'.
A c-input cell gives you an opportunity to push the network out of a consistent state,
so that it must find another consistent state (raise the temperature, force the motor
and fuel pump to stop). They are one way the network interacts with its environment.
(Thinking about GUI: Part of the 'environment' of your Cells-GTK application are lisp objects, 
the state of which you'd like to communicate to the user.)
<p/>
Another way that the cells network can interact with its environment is through 
c-output (or c-echo) methods. These are 'observers' of a cell that are invoked when the 
value of that cell is modified. They are sort of the converse of the c-input: modify
a c-input value and the network reacts; when the network reacts, it can modify
values outside the network with a c-output.
<p/>
So what about the values <em>inside</em> the network -- the nodes with edges pointing into them? 
Observing those with c-output methods and using c-input and setf to modify them would be 
bad form. If you program that way, you aren't doing anything that couldn't be done without Cells. 
Drop Cells-GTK and go back to programming in C-based GTK or Java. The result will be that you 
hand back to the programmer the burden of keeping track of every change to the GUI.
C-input cells are intended (small apps like Bill's aside) to be used to 'instrument' 
(or "put sensors on") your code. If you have a legacy code that you are building a Cells-GTK GUI for, ....
<p/>


<!--
[They are what allow the object represented by the network to interact with its environment.]

<p/> 


<p/>
Now reiterating the ideas above:

<ul> 
  <li>A <strong>cell</strong> is a slot in a CLOS object whose value is managed by accessors that are 
  part of a cells constraint network.
  <li>A <strong>cells constraint network</strong> is a collection of cells that are interrelated through 
      reference to each other or through reference to other lisp objects, through any level of indirection.
  <li>A <strong>c-input cell</strong> is a cell whose value may be set through explicit procedural code, 
      using setf on the slot. Note:  setf-ing the cell causes the values of other cells to be recomputed --
      provided the cell is referenced by other cells in a cells constraint network.</li>
  <li>A <strong>c-formula cell</strong> is a cell whose value is obtained through evaluation of a formula.
      Note: The usual semantics of :initform do not apply when :initform is given by c-formula. 
      Instead of just setting the value at initialization, a formula (derived from the supplied lisp form) 
      specifies the dynamic relationship between the slot's value and other aspects of the program state. 
  <li>A <strong>c-output method</strong> is a method on a cell that is evaluated when the value of the
      cell changes. 
</ul>

Cells provides for the declaration of several kinds of "cell slots," 
but for the purpose of talking about cells-gtk, we can limit the discussion to 
just the c-input  and c-formula cells. How do you recognize what kind of cell slot
is being used? Well, first we should point out that by specifying 
:cell nil in a defmodel slot definition, the slot defined is an ordinary CLOS 
slot. The rest are specified using :initform on the slot. The following defmodel 
defines a c-input cell, a c-formula cell and a regular CLOS slot.

<pre>
(defmodel example ()
  ((control-me :initform (c-input (some-form-foo)) :accessor control-me)
   (im-computed :initform (c-formula (some-form-bar)) :accessor im-computed)
   (im-clos :cell nil :initform nil)))
</pre>

<tt>
<pre>

         slot
        /    \
     CLOS   cell
            /   \
     invariant  variant
                 /    \
      input-valued   formula-valued
</pre>
</tt>

The figure above depicts a taxonomy of cell slots. 
<strong>Cell slots</strong> can be categorized as <strong>invariant</strong> or 
<strong>variant</strong>. <strong>Variant</strong> slots can be further categorized 
as <strong>input-valued</strong> and <strong>formula-valued</strong>. 
Some definitions:

<ul> 
        
<li>A <strong>cell slot</strong> is specified by :cell t (advanced options aside) 
or by omitting the :cell option, since in defmodel, the default is t.</li>

<li>An <strong>invariant cell slot</strong> is a cell slot that is initialized 
by an ordinary lisp form, either by an :initarg in make-instance, an :initform
in the slot definition, or :default-initargs in the defmodel. The value of an 
invariant cell slot should not be modified. Attempting to change it with setf
will signal an error. (setf slot-value) is available for exceptional situations. </li>

<li>A <strong>variant cell slot</strong> is a cell slot that is initialized 
by (c-in ...) or (c? ...) in an :initarg in make-instance, or an :initform in the
slot definition, or :default-initargs in the defmodel. Variant cell slot is an
abstract notion; all variant cell slots are either input-valued or formula-valued.</li>

<li>An variant cell slot is <strong>input-valued</strong> if it is initialized 
by c-in. Input-valued variant cell serves as a port to the outside world. 
They can be SETFed by imperative code, by events initiated by the user, for example. </li>

<li>Finally, <strong>formula-valued</strong> variant cell slots are really 
what Cells is about. A formula-valued cell slot is a variant cell slot whose
value is obtained by the evaluation of a form (c? ...) form, a "formula."
The formula may reference any value, but the intent is that some of 
those value are from cells. (It seems to naturally works out that way too). 
The cells system guarantees that the system of relationships described by c? slots 
are consistent at some point after the values of some of them are changed.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Cells and Cells-GTK</h2>

<h2>Good Cells Technique</h2>

This all may seem abstract, but it has practical
value in the design of your GUI. For example, I might set the :sensitivity
of a button, the :text in a label or :fraction of a progress-bar based on 
the presence or value of an object in another cell slot, or some relationship
of cells slots described by the formula. Thus the problem of remembering
"what to set when" is reduced to answering the question, <em>"What does the 
state of the widget presented to the user represent about the state 
of the program?"</em> The formula addresses that question directly, and is placed 
at the widget presenting itself.

<h2>A few notes</h2>

<ul> 

<li> As the above suggests, the kind of cell slot can be determined uniformly
for all instances of the class, using an initform/default-initargs, 
or individually at make-instance using an :initarg.</li>

<li>The rationale for invariant cell slots it that they enable the Cells system to 
perform certain optimizations. Those optimizations would be invalid were the 
value to be changed.</li>

<li>Formula, that is (c? ...) forms, do not evaluate until shortly after
 make-instance time. In the case of the family class, this happens after 
a new instance has been inserted in the family tree, and since instances 
can see their parents, a slot rule can call on any information in the 
model world in determining its value.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Cell Input, Output, and Formula-valued Cells</h1>

The above described the purpose of the input cell. There is often the
complementary need to react to the change of a value. <strong>def-c-output</strong>
defines a method named for a cell slot and specialied on a defmodel defining 
the slot (or one of its subclasses, the usual CLOS rules apply).
<p/>
The def-c-output method is invoked through process of propagation of an change to
an input as follows:
<ul>
   <li> Change the slot value. </li>
   <li> Output the slot value (call the DEF-C-OUTPUTs)</li>
   <li> Propagate the change to using formula-valued cells. For each cell that 
        decides on a changed value (changed being user-definable), begin at the top</li>
   <li> When all recursive propagation has completed, execute any SETFs of 
        c-inputs deferred during DEF-C-OUTPUT calls. (Yes, outputs can setf 
        inputs. Envison a fish jumping out of the water and then falling back in).</li> 
</ul>

Each SETF gets process in order by starting from the top.
<p/>
The above happens with the following guarantee: When an input changes, 
all dependencies (direct or indirect) are considered "stale" until they 
are recomputed. The guarantee ensures that no cell slot accessor will ever 
return a "stale" value.
<p/>
Note that concerning outputs setf-ing inputs, each SETF is 
considered a "discrete generation" if you will. This is why all 
propagation to formula-valued cell dependencies has to happen before any output 
SETF (and why Cells has a mechanism to defer SETFs of inputs).

<h1>Family: Referencing cells throughout the defmodel hierarchy.</h1>

The <strong>defmodel</strong> macro defines a part-subpart relationship 
among components of the interface. The relationship is made by the <strong>:kids</strong> initarg. 
<strong>:kids</strong> is given a list of children. In a cells-gtk defmodel some kids might be GTKContainer 
(vbox, hbox, etc) -- things that in the GTK world, have kids of their own. It may be a natural coding practice 
in that case for the defmodel to define a fairly deep ancestory hierarchy, laying out the arrangement of widgets. 
(You're free to break things up wherever seem reasonable for your application). It might look like this:

<pre>
(defmodel my-app (gtk-app)
  ()
  (:default-initargs
  :md-name :my-app
  :kids 
  (list 
    (mk-vbox
      :kids
        (list 
           (mk-hbox
	      :kids
                 (list (mk-combo-box :md-name :my-combo) ...))
           (mk-hbox
	       :kids
                (list (make-instance 'my-subpart))))))))
</pre>
The point of the Family methods is to allow things a different places in this hierarchy (e.g. :my-combo
to reference :my-app).
