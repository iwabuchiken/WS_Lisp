<strong id="q1">Q: What is Cells-GTK?</strong><p/>
<strong>A:</strong> Cells-GTK is a lisp binding of GTK written by Vasilis Margioulas. It uses the 
Cells system, a sort of constraint propagation system written by kenny tilton.
(see "What is Cells?"). As of this writing Cells-GTK runs under Allegro, Lispworks, CMUCL, SBCL
and CLISP. 
<p/>
<strong id="q2">Q: What is Cells?</strong><p/>
<strong>A:</strong> From the Cells website: "Cells is a mature, stable extension to CLOS that allows you 
   to create classes, the instances of which have slots whose values are determined by 
   a formula." 
<p/>
From <a href='http://bc.tech.coop/blog/030911.html'>Bill Clementson's Blog</a>: 
 "...Cells allows you to define classes whose slots can be dynamically 
  (and automatically) updated and for which standard 'observers' can be defined that react to changes 
  in those slots."
<p/> 
   Here is an explanation from the viewpoint of a Cells-GTK programmer:
   Cells provides Cells-GTK with two essential features: (1) a part-subpart relationship,
   as is typically found in GUIs -- it allows the user to express that, e.g., this window contains these 
   buttons and subwindows etc.; (2) the expression of a program's state machine, as viewed from the 
   context of the user's interaction through the GUI. This last point is especially noteworthy, and 
   needs more explanation. If you are at all familiar with developing moderately complex software
   that is operated through a GUI, then you have probably learned this lesson: Keeping what is presented through 
   the GUI in-sync with what the user is allowed to do, and in-sync with the computational state of 
   the program is often tedious, complicated work. Specifically, there are the issues of what menu items 
   ought to be made sensitive when, what items should be presented in list, what text should appear in
   entries, etc. Cells-GTK helps with these tasks by providing an abstraction over the details; each
   of the tasks just listed can be controlled by (a) formula that specify the value of attributes of graphic 
   features in the part-subpart declaration (that declaration is called 'defpart' in cells-gtk); 
   and, (b) formula that specify the value of CLOS slots. [Footnote, In the details of the implementation, 
   (a) is just a usage of (b). But it helps to think of the ability to set a GUI feature with a
   formula as something different than setting the value of slot with a formula.]. (c) 'observers' (to 
   use Bill Clementson's term) that watch over GUI features and react to changes. 
<p/>
   An example of (a)
   is setting the :sensitive feature of a GTK menu item. For this, I might use the formula (c? (user-file *my-gui*)).
   Here user-file is the accessor of some object *my-gui*. :sensitive is a boolean, so whenever there
   is a non-nil value in the slot user-file, the menu item is sensitive. That doesn't look a whole lot 
   different than giving :sensitive whatever value (user-file *my-gui*) evaluates to.
   The difference is that in Cells-GTK, the Cells codes watches over 'instrumented' slots such as user-file 
   and automatically updates those attributes of a Cell-GTK object (such as a menu item's :sensitive feature) 
   that are governed by a Cells formula. Thus, I don't have to explicitly update the value of 
   :sensitive -- it happens automatically. 
   <p/>
   So what is this talk about 'expression of a program's state machine?' Well, the idea is that 
   in a GUI operated by Cells-GTK, transition into a state is governed by cells-formulae on 
   GUI features and cells-instrumented slots. E.g. when the user loads a file, (c? (user-file *my-gui*))
   becomes true and the program enters the state where some menu item that wasn't sensitive now is 
   -- the cells formulae are formulae on the arcs out of states. Is that stretching it too much? 
   I don't know, it makes sense to me.

<strong id="q3">Q: What is required to deliver executables?</strong><p/>
There is only one data point that I know of with respect to this; I created an Win32 .exe
using Lispworks. The code is available to anyone who might what to take a look (email me, it's
not on a server anywhere). The <a href="http://www.mel.nist.gov/msid/MIV.html">.exe</a> is available too.<p/>
Key aspects of the design:
  <ul>
    <li>I included with the GTK libraries with my application, so that the user didn't have
        to mess around with finding and installing them. Whether that was really the best approach is
        debatable. If I instead asked the user to get the GTK libraries and install them him/herself, they 
        would be placed where libraries are usually found, and screwing around with *gtk-lib-path* might
        not have been necessary. Even better, if I really knew what I was doing with NSIS, I might have
        been able to install the libraries and my application on separate paths. 
    <li>I used the <a href="http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Main_Page">NSIS</a> open source installer 
        creation tool, which works nicely and, importantly, allowed me to add to the PATH variable. 
        My software looks for GTK on the path to determine where it was installed. It 
        then set *gtk-lib-path*.
    <li>That's it!
  </ul>


<strong id="q5">Q: Did anyone really ask these questions?</strong><p/>
<strong>A:</strong> Naw, I (Peter Denno) am just talking to myself. 
<p/>
<strong id="q6">Q: What GTK Widgets are implemented in cells-gtk?</strong><p/>
<strong>A:</strong> [hmm, Better to ask what isn't. Most of the useful widgets are implemented, but
    among those, many non-essential methods are not.] A quick look at the 
<a href="http://developer.gnome.org/doc/API/2.0/gtk/ch02.html">widget gallery</a>.... These
are not implemented:
<ul>
  <li>GtkColorButton</li>
  <li>GtkFileChooserButton </li>
  <li>GtkFontButton </li>
  <li>GtkIconView</li>
  <li>GtkStatusBar</li>
  <li>GtkFontSelectionDialog</li>
  <li>GtkColorSelectionDialog</li>
</ul>
<p/>There are quite a few other widgets not listed in the Gallery that aren't implmented.
But BTW, it isn't difficult to implement most of these. If you need one, implement
it and drop us a note! (If you need help, just ask.)

<p/>
<strong id="q7">Q: Do I have to use cells?</strong><p/>
<strong>A:</strong> Probably not. But the demo uses them, so it might still be (despite the lack of 
documentation of the cells API) the path of least resistance. (This answer is
mostly to shame kenny tilton into writing some documentation ;^). There is at least a few
applications (mine) that uses them productively. See also:
        <ul>
          <li><a href='http://common-lisp.net/project/cells/'>Cells on common-lisp.net</a></li>
          <li><a href='http://www.tilton-technology.com/cells_top.html'>Cells at tilton-technology.com</a></li>
          <li><a href='http://bc.tech.coop/blog/030911.html'>Bill Clementson's Blog, Cells entry</a></li>
       </ul>
<p/>
<strong id="q8">Q: What is libcellsgtk.so about?</strong><p/>
<strong>A:</strong> Sometimes there is a need to access something that isn't nominally part of the GTK API
   but really is part of the GTK API as far as C programmers are concerned. An example of
   this is found in the specification of dialog vboxes where the spec says to
   just use dialog->vbox because:
<p/>
<tt>
<pre>
   typedef struct {
      GtkWidget *vbox;
      GtkWidget *action_area;
   } GtkDialog;
</pre>
</tt>

  But the truth is that this isn't what that C struct really looks like. 
  It looks like this: 
<tt>
<pre>
   typedef struct _GtkDialog  GtkDialog;
   struct _GtkDialog
   {
      GtkWindow window;
      /*&lt; public &gt;*/
      GtkWidget *vbox;
      GtkWidget *action_area;
      /*&lt; private &gt;*/
     GtkWidget *separator;
  };
</pre>
</tt>
  
  ... and window is a big struct that might change from gtk version to gtk version.
  Therefore there is no easy way for us (lisp ffi) to know how to address into the 
  structure to get the vbox, so we wrote a 3 line c program to get it. (And other
  3 line programs to do similar things). 
  <p/>
  You don't need libcellsgtk.so to run the demo, but you will to:
    <ul>
       <li> add an entry text widget to a dialog</li>
       <li> add menu items using populate-popup (see GTK textview) </li>
       <li> be able to programmatically modify the text in a textview</li>
    </ul>
  (As of this writing, those are the only situations). To use libcellsgtk.so you need 
  to compile it. And that requires having access to the C header files corresponding 
  the libgtk.so you are using. 

<p/>
<strong id="q8.4">Q: What is in libcellsgtk.so?</strong><p/>
<strong>A:</strong>For details look at the source gtk-ffi/gtk-adds.c, but generally:
<ul>
  <li>Get a dialog's vbox (so that you can add children to it).</li>
  <li>Get the popup menu of a textview</li>
  <li>Allocate text iters and tree iters</li>
  <li>Check whether or not a widget is mapped and visible</li>
  <li>Get the window of a widget (useful for DrawingArea).</li>
  <li>Allocate GdkColor objects</li>
  <li>Set the RGB values of GdkColor objects.</li>
</ul>

<p/>
<strong id="q8.5">Q: What is the difference between using c-input (AKA c-in) and c-formula (AKA c?) in a slot's 
:initform ?</strong><p/>
<strong>A:</strong>The two define different kinds of cells:<br/>
A c-input cell is a cell whose value may be set through explicit procedural code, using setf on the slot.
Note: When the cell is referenced by other cells in a cells constraint network, setf-ing the cell
causes the values of other cells to be recomputed. 
<br/>
A c-formula cell is a cell whose value is obtained through evaluation of a formula.
<br/>
Note that the usual semantics of :initform do not apply when :initform is given by c-formula. 
Instead of just setting the value at initialization, the c-formula (generated from the supplied lisp form) 
specifies the dynamic relationship between the slot's value and other aspects of the program state. 
<p/>

<strong id="q9">Q: Why do I need :owner here? It looks like c? would bind self to the mk-whatever
   enclosing the c?</strong><p/>
<tt>
<pre>
:popup ; of a treebox
(c?
  (mk-menu
   :owner self
   :kids 
   (c?
     (list
      (mk-menu-item :label "Describe"
                    :on-activate 
                    (callback (w e d)
                      (md-value (owner (upper self menu)))
                      (show-message (m:describe-item (md-value (owner (upper self menu)))))))))))
</pre>
</tt>
<p/>
<strong>A:</strong> :popup isn't :kids. So you need another way to get into the kids hierarchy of the parent.
(upper self menu) gets us to the menu and (owner (upper self menu)) jumps into the kids 
hierarchy, since c? always binds self to the containing mk-whatever object. (the outer c? does that here).

<tt>
<pre>
;;-- Another example, 

:populate-popup ; of a text-view
(c? (mk-menu-item :label "Expression Templates"
                  :owner self
                  :on-activate 
                  (callback (w e d)
                    (show-message (format nil "XPath Nonsense self = ~A" (owner self))))))
</pre>
</tt>
<p/>
<strong>A:</strong> If you macroexpand callback, you will see that it binds self again, this time to the 
   menu-item. <br/><tt>(owner self)</tt> gets you into the :kids hierarchy. 
<p/>
<strong id="q10">Q: How do I do xyz?</strong><p/>
<strong>A:</strong> If xyz concerns Cells-GTK or the use of Cells in Cells-GTK, ask your question 
   on the <a href="http://common-lisp.net/mailman/listinfo/cells-gtk-devel">project
   mailing list</a>. The GTK documentation is also very helpful... And if it 
   comes to it, adding the foreign function binding from the GTK API isn't hard either.
<p/>
<strong id="q11">Q: What does this error mean? : "cellular slot FOO of #&lt;BAR 21B555A4&gt; cannot be setf 
                    unless initialized as inputp."</strong><p/>
  <strong>A:</strong>This error is signalled because you tried to setf a c-formula slot.
            'inputp' refers to c-input (declaration of an input cell) which should have been used 
            to initialize the slot.
            Read the <a href="cgtk-primer.html">cells-gtk primer</a> for more 
            information.
<p/>
<strong id="q12">Q: Changing a cell value causes dependencies to fire, but what is considered a change?</strong><p/>
   <strong>A:</strong> As you are suggesting, setting a slot to an "equivalent" object should not cause its
     dependencies to fire again (in order to save substantial useless recalculations). So how is 
     "equivalence" defined? EQL is used unless overridden by providing a function of two arguments 
     to :unchanged-if in the slot definition of the defmodel. 


<p/>
<strong id="q13">Q: Can I keep a window around for redisplay after using the window border 
                    'delete' button to delete it?</strong><p/>
   <strong>A:</strong>Yes. Do something like this:

<tt>
<pre>
(defmodel pseudo-dialog (window)
  ()
  (:default-initargs
   :on-delete-event (callback (w e d) (gtk-widget-hide-on-delete w))))
</pre>
</tt>
<p/>
... and, of course, store the widget somewhere so you can later display it with
 (gtk-widget-show-all (widget-id my-pseudo-dialog)).

<p/>

<strong id="q14">Q:Can I use streams with a TextView widget?</strong><p/>
 <strong>A:</strong>Sure. Do something like this:

<pre>
(defmethod initialize-instance :after ((self your-gtk-app) &key)
  (let ((message-textview [wherever it is]))
    (setf *message-stream* 
	(make-instance 'pane-stream 
		       :buffer (buffer message-textview)
		       :view message-textview))))

(defclass pane-stream (stream:fundamental-character-output-stream)
  ((view :initarg :view)
   (buffer :initarg :buffer)
   (mark :initarg :mark)
   (offset :initform 0 :accessor offset)))

(defmethod initialize-instance :after ((self pane-stream) &key)
  (with-slots (buffer mark view) self
     (let ((b (widget-id buffer))
	   (v (widget-id view)))
       (with-text-iters (iter) 
          (cgtk:gtk-text-buffer-get-iter-at-offset b iter 0)
	  (setf mark (cgtk:gtk-text-buffer-create-mark b "visibility" iter t)))
       (cgtk:gtk-text-view-set-wrap-mode v 1)  ; optional, of course. 
       (cgtk:gtk-text-view-set-editable v nil)))) ; also optional. 

; Some lisps might not need this one. Some might need other methods.
(defmethod stream:stream-line-column ((s pane-stream)) nil)

(defmethod stream:stream-write-char ((s pane-stream) (c character))
  (with-slots (view buffer offset mark) s
     (cgtk:text-buffer-insert-text buffer offset (string c))
     (incf offset)
     (let ((buf (widget-id buffer)))
       (with-text-iters (iter) 
         (cgtk:gtk-text-buffer-get-iter-at-offset buf iter offset)
	 (cgtk:gtk-text-buffer-move-mark buf mark iter)
	 (cgtk:gtk-text-view-scroll-mark-onscreen (cgtk::id view) mark )))))

(defmethod stream:stream-write-string ((s pane-stream) string &optional start end)
  (with-slots (view buffer offset mark) s
     (cgtk:text-buffer-insert-text buffer offset string)
     (incf offset (length string))
     (let ((buf (widget-id buffer)))
       (with-text-iters (iter) 
         (cgtk:gtk-text-buffer-get-iter-at-offset buf iter offset)
	 (cgtk:gtk-text-buffer-move-mark buf mark iter)
	 (cgtk:gtk-text-view-scroll-mark-onscreen (widget-id view) mark)))))
