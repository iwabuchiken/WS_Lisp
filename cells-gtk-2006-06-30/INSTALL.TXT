To compile and run:

STEP 0: WINDOWS USERS: Do the stuff marked "Windows Users" below.

STEP .5: CLISP Users edit the path in ./load.lisp (you'll see it).

STEP 1: EVERYONE: Start lisp, change to this directory and do (load "load")

STEP 2: EVERYONE: (test-gtk::gtk-demo)

STEP 3: ANYONE (optional) make libcellsgtk, (or get it from the cells-gtk site). To make:
         3a) In ./root/gtk-ffi 'make' 
         3b) Move the library created to where it will be found (Linux see /etc/ld.so.conf).
         3c) Uncomment the line (pushnew :libcellsgtk *features*) in ./root/gtk-ffi/gtk-ffi.asd
         3d) Recompile the distribution (remove fasls and type (load "load") again.


TESTED ON:
    Windows XP: (with gtk 2.4.10) 
       AllegroCL 6.2 Enterprise, 
       Lispworks 4.3 Personal
    Windows 2000:
       CLISP 2.38
    Linux: 
      Lispworks 4.4 Pro, 
      CMUCL 19c, 
      CLISP 2.36
      SBCL 0.9.9.1

NOT TESTED SINCE SWITCHING TO CFFI: (as of 2006-01-03):
    AllegroCL
    MACOSX

;;; --------   Windows Users ---------------

Get GTK and Install

   http://gimp-win.sourceforge.net/stable.html  (I used version 2.8.9)
   
   Executing the setup.exe should add "C:\Program Files\Common Files\GTK\2.0\bin"
   to your path. You can verify that it has:

   Start>Settings>Control Panel>System>Advanced>Environment Variables>

   (I had to reboot after this, but then I don't know anything about Win32).

Note: On windows under emacs with slime, the gtk window does not popup. 
      You must start the application from a dos prompt. 
      (Solutions to this problem welcome!, probably involves putting something
       like a call to gtk-iteration-do into some slime loop through a hook.)

Known bugs:
    On Windows: Clisp crashes if    
    [My Computer]-> [Properties]-> [Advanced]-> [Perfomance Settings]-> [Show windows contents while dragging] 
    is set and resize the window while viewing a listbox or treebox.
